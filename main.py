# Sort the packages using the following criteria:

# - A package is **bulky** if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or when one of its dimensions is greater or equal to 150 cm.
# - A package is **heavy** when its mass is greater or equal to 20 kg.

# You must dispatch the packages in the following stacks:

# - **STANDARD**: standard packages (those that are not bulky or heavy) can be handled normally.
# - **SPECIAL**: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
# - **REJECTED**: packages that are **both** heavy and bulky are rejected.
